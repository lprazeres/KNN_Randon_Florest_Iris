# KNN_Randon_Florest_Iris

Project Description: Comparing KNN and Random Forest on the Iris Dataset
Objective:

The goal of this project was to compare the performance of two machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest, on the well-known Iris dataset. The objective was to determine which model is more suitable for classifying the species of iris flowers based on their features.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset contains 150 records and four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The target variable is the flower species, categorized into three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

Approach:
Data preprocessing, including standardization for KNN due to its sensitivity to scale.
Implementation of the KNN and Random Forest models.
Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Testing the models with new input data for prediction.

Conclusion:
Both models demonstrated high accuracy (93.33%) in classifying the Iris dataset, making them effective for this task. However, KNN is recommended for its simplicity and faster training process, especially when working with small datasets and straightforward use cases.

This project highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on the context and requirements of the problem.

The full implementation, along with code and visualizations, is available in this repository.
